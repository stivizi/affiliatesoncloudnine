Subject: Welcome You to Our On Cloud Nine Affiliate Family!

Dear [Recipient's Name],

Thank you for expressing interest in joining our affiliate program. It's important for us to find partners who share that passion for creating truly magical experiences.

On Cloud Nine is our stunning 26-acre venue in Victoria's Cordova Bay, featuring rolling hayfields, charming barns, and that perfect rustic elegance your clients will absolutely love. We're conveniently located just 15 minutes from downtown Victoria and 20 minutes from the airport.

Our affiliate program is designed to reward you generously for referrals – with commissions ranging from 10-15% on successful bookings, plus our tiered structure that increases your earnings as you grow with us. But beyond the financial side, it's about being part of a supportive community where we all help each other succeed.

The application process is incredibly straightforward – just a simple online form, and you'll immediately gain access to our marketing materials, dedicated support, and start earning commissions on your referrals.

All that said, I'd love for you to experience the venue firsthand at our upcoming open house. It's the best way to see why couples and planners alike fall in love with On Cloud Nine.

**Open House Event**
**Thursday, November 6th, 2025**
**4:00 PM - 7:00 PM**

Light snacks, beverages, and a guided tour of our beautiful grounds – plus plenty of time to chat with other industry friends who are already part of our community.

Are you able to join us on November 6th? I'd be delighted to show you around personally and answer any questions about our venue or the affiliate program.

Looking forward to welcoming you to the On Cloud Nine family soon!

Warm regards,
